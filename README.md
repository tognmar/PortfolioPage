## CollecTic
- CollecTic is a full-stack web app developed as a 3-week project for concert and event enthusiasts to digitally archive and showcase their ticket collections. Users can upload or photograph tickets, and AI extracts event details (artist, venue, date, location), which are stored in a personal gallery. An interactive map displays all attended event locations.

ðŸ”§ Note: This project is a work in progress.

### Key Features

- **Upload or Photograph Tickets:** Add tickets by uploading an image/PDF or taking a photo directly within the app.
- **AI-Powered Ticket Scanning:** Automatically extract event details (artist, venue, date, location) using GPT-4o-mini via the OpenAI API.
- **Personal Ticket Gallery**: View and manage a personalized, visual archive of your event history.
- **Interactive Map of Events:** All attended event locations are plotted on a Leaflet.js-powered map.
- **Social Features:** Follow other users, view their profiles, and explore their ticket collections.
